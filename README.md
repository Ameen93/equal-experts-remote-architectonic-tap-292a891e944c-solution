Thanks for taking the time to review my submission!

1. What kind of data quality measures would you apply to your solution in production?

Schema validation, data type checks

2. What would need to change for the solution scale to work with a 10TB dataset with 5GB new data arriving each day?

Use a container and Apache to optimize the data ingestion.
